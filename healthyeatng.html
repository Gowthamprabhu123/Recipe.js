        <P>With Thanksgiving just a few days away, you might be feeling the pressure to finalize your holiday menu and
            ensure everything is ready for the big day. Hosting Thanksgiving can be stressful, but one way to make your
            life a little easier is by serving an easy and crowd-pleasing appetizer like a charcuterie board.</P>

        <P> At its core, a charcuterie board is filled with cheese and preserved meats, but people often add their own
            touch by incorporating ingredients like fruits, vegetables, dips, and chocolates. Some have even created
            fully vegan charcuterie boards by omitting the meat and cheese and opting for plant-based snacks. The idea
            behind a charcuterie board is to have your guests gather around, engage in conversation, and anticipate the
            main course.</P>
